# todo
- create media queries to allow this start page to work on smaller displays
- create an option to allow pywal colours to be used in the configuration process
- move colours into a separate css file to allow for easy configuration
- optimize weather and date setting so that they can be set instantly
- add a bookmarks option (maybe), similar to firefox
- still W.I.P. If there are any bugs, create an issue or PR :)
